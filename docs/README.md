## Quick Reference

- **Getting Started**: See main `README.md` in project root
- **Detailed Project Info**: See `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- **System Architecture**: See `ARCHITECTURE_AND_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
- **TLS 1.3 Work**: See `extending12to13_README.md`
- **Testing**: See `tests/README.md` and `tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md`

## Recommendation

**Keep:**
- ✅ PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (comprehensive reference)
- ✅ ARCHITECTURE_AND_ASSUMPTIONS.md (technical architecture)
- ✅ extending12to13_README.md (TLS 1.3 specific)

**Consider Removing:**
- ⚠️ QUICKSTART.md (redundant with main README.md)

The main `README.md` already provides a good overview and quick start. The detailed docs in this folder serve as reference material for deeper understanding.
