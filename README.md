# IoT-Traffic-Models
TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.3-enabled Malware (Hasan)	MQTT, COAP:v1, RTSP (Andrea)	Different mirai attacks on Danmini Doorbell Device	Mirai attacks to IoT devices in CICIOT lab (GRE)	DNS-Based Command & Control (Jaime)
Encryption - TLS/Quic
Not - Encrypted 


MoE - Multiple of Experts

1- check if encrypted - deterministic tool
2- if:
	encrypted - we use the TLS AI model, deterministic decision (ideal - AI model that decides QUIC vs TLS vs DTLS) - check if DNS traffic can be recognize when encrypted.
	not encrypted -  we use AI model(the selector) to recognize the not encrypted context and run the matching expert, it will include 2 classifications, device based and protocol based

Infrastructure:
Table of accuracy per context/AI model
Trained AI models

Enhancements - 
Result of best 2 for each context
Light retraining DPI
